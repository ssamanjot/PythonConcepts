Coroutines are a general control structure whereby flow control is cooperatively passed between two different routines without returning.

StringToASCIIConversion.py is coded to calculate the average ASCII value of characters in a given TXT file up to two decimal places without the use of coroutines, ignoring all whitespace characters.

CoroutinesStringToASCII.py is coded to calculate the average ASCII value of characters in a given TXT file up to two decimal places using coroutines, ignoring all whitespace characters.

Both the programs can take any of the three TXT files((graveyard.txt, JRRT.txt, and GM.txt)) as input in program and calculate the average ASCII value of characters for that TXT file.
